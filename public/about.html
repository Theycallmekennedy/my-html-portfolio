<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Kennedy Ezuruike Nnadozie is a Lagos-based creative whose path blends music production, social media strategy, and entrepreneurial drive.
   He's the kind of person who thrives in both structured environments and free-flowing creative spaces, which is why his transition into front-end web development and digital marketing feels so natural.
   When he works, he thinks in systems, stories, and sounds all at once.</p>

<p>He's the mind behind brands like Kendy Records and One or Two Enterprises, where he handles everything from production to creative direction.
   Whether he's mixing vocals, building out a marketing plan, or shaping the online presence of restaurants and fashion brands, he brings the same mix of clarity, intention, and instinct.
   People trust him because he doesn't just do the work, he understands the culture around it.</p>

<p>At the heart of it all, Kennedy is driven by growth. He's always learning something new, pushing his skills into new territory, 
   and looking for ways to elevate both himself and the people he works with. Music, tech, storytelling. 
   They all meet in his hands, and that blend is what gives his work its edge.</p>
